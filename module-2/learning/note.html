  <h1>Note module-2</h1>
  <h2>This</h2>
  <h3>Method shorthand </h3>
  <p>
    const user = {
    name: blabla,
    sayHi() {
    console.log(this.name);
    }
    }
  </p>
  <p>
    The value of this is object before dot for instance
    user.sayHi(); this === user
  </p>
  <p>
    Same function can be assigned to two diferent objects and has differnt this in this calls.
    Calling without an object this === undefined in strict mode in non-strict thi value of this will be the window
    (global object)
  </p>
  <h3>Summary </h3>
  <p>
    Funtions that are stored in objects properties are called 'methods'
    Method can refernce the objects as this
    The value of this is defined at run-time:
    When the function is declared, it may use this, but that this has no value until the method is called
    A funtcion can be copied between the objects
    Arrow funtion have no this. When this is accesed inside an arrow functon is taken from outside.
  </p>
  <h2>Object to primitive conversion</h2>
  <p>
    Object are true in a boolean context.
    The numeric conversion happens when we substruct objects or apply mathematical functions.
    As for the sting conversion.
    We can fine-tune string and numeric conversion using special object method.
    The are three variants of type converision so-called hints:
    String, Number, default (occurs in rare cases when when the operator is not sure what type to expect)
  </p>

  <h3>To do conversion, JS tries to find and call three object methods: </h3>

  <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>
      <div>Call obj[Symbol.toPrimitive](hint)</div>
      <div>Instance:</div>
      <div style="white-space: pre-wrap">
        let user = {
          name: 'Jonh',
          money: 1000,

          [Symbol.toPrimitive](hint) {
          console.log(`hint: ${hint}`);

          return hint == "string" ? `{name: "${this.name}"}` : this.money;
          }
        }

        alert(user);
        alert(+user);
        alert(user + 500);

        The single method handels 
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>If hint string try obj.toString() and obj.valueOf()</div>
      <div>
        <p>
          This methods come from ancient times. If there is no Symbol.toPrimitive then JS tries to find them and try in the order: 
          toString -> valueOf for string and vice versa for number. 
          Thise methods must return primitive value, otherwise treat them if there were no method
          By default toString return a string "[object Object]", valueOf return the object itself (for historical reasons). 
        </p>
        <p>
          Combination of them does the same as code above. 
          If we want handle all primitive converision we can implement toSting.          
        </p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>If hint number or default try obj.valueOf() and obj.toString()</div>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Further converision: if the resulting primitive isn't of the right tipe, it will be converted.</p>


  <h2>Constructor, operator new </h2>
  <p>Using for create many similar objects.</p>
  <p>Constructor, regular funtian but named with capital letter first, should be executed only with new operator.</p>
  <p>When a funtion executed with new it does following steps:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>A new empty object is created and assigned this. // this = {}</li>
    <li>The funtion body executes. Usually it modifies this, adds new properties to it. // this.name = 'smth';</li>
    <li>The value of this is returned. // return {};</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Arrow functions, the basics</h2>
  <p>Call that because look like arrow</p>
  <p>Instanse: let sum = (a,b) => a + b </p>
  <p>By default return result</p>
  <p>
    If one argument we can omit parentheses, we thre are no
    arguments, parentheses will be empty.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we want multiple statement or expressions we should 
    enclose expresion to curly braces. Then use normal 
    return
  </p>

  <h2>Automated testing with Mocha</h2>
  <p>Automated teting run our code in various ways and compare result with the expected.</p>
    
  
  <h3>Behavior Driver Development</h3>
  <p>BDD is three things in one: test and documentation and examples</p>
  <p>Description is called specification or, in short, spec, and contains
    description of use cases together with test for them </p>
  <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
    describe("pow", function() { // what funtionality we describing
      it("raises to n-th power", function(){ // particular use case and funtion that test it
        assert.equal(pow(2, 3), 8); // error if first argumnet !== second;
      });
    });
  </p>
  <p>Making test separeted more useful (two or more "it"), in one block it 
    test not going forfard after first fail and we'll never see result of second assert</p>
  <p>
    We can generate it block in loop (for). 
  </p>
  <p>We can nested describe for better structure of complecated tests</p>
  <p>Exists block before/after, beforeEach/afterEach</p>
